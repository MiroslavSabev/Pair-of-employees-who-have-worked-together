# Pair-of-employees-who-have-worked-together
The task of the program is to find pairs of employees who have worked together on common projects and to determine the duration of their shared projects. The program takes input from a CSV file which contains data on employees, their projects and the start and end dates of each project. The program processes this data to create a map where each employee is associated with a list of projects and their start and end dates. The program then iterates through each pair of employees and determines the total duration of their shared projects. The program outputs the pair of employees with the longest duration of shared projects and the duration for each shared project.
The algorithm used in the program first reads the CSV file using a BufferedReader and FileReader. The data is then stored in a HashMap with each employee ID as the key and a map of their project IDs and project start and end dates as the value. The program then iterates through all pairs of employees using two nested for-loops, and for each pair, calculates the duration of their shared projects. The pair with the longest duration is stored in variables empId1 and empId2 along with the duration in maxDuration. Finally, the program outputs the pair with the longest duration and the duration for each shared project. The duration is calculated using the getDurationOverlap method which finds the overlapping duration between two date ranges.
